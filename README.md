An AI-powered real-time coach for Clash Royale that uses computer vision to provide a strategic advantage by tracking opponent elixir and card cycles.

## About The Project

This project is a desktop assistant designed for competitive Clash Royale players. It passively reads the game screen without modifying game files, providing a lightweight overlay with crucial real-time data that is normally left to memory and guesswork. The goal is to demonstrate a powerful end-to-end application of computer vision, real-time data processing, and modern desktop app development.

## Key Features (MVP)

  * **‚ö° Real-time Card Recognition:** A Python-based vision engine using a custom-trained YOLO model to identify opponent card plays live.
  * **üíß Live Elixir Tracking:** The app accurately calculates the opponent's current elixir by tracking their plays and passive generation.
  * **üîÑ Card Cycle Display:** A clean UI overlay shows the last four cards the opponent has played, revealing their current hand and upcoming cycle.
  * **üñ•Ô∏è Lightweight Desktop Overlay:** Built with Tauri and React to ensure minimal impact on game performance.

## Tech Stack

This project is composed of three main services:

  * **Frontend (Desktop App):**

      * [Tauri](https://tauri.app/): For building a lightweight, performant desktop application.
      * [React](https://reactjs.org/): For building the user interface.
      * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type-safe code.

  * **AI / Vision Engine:**

      * [Python](https://www.python.org/): Core language for the vision script.
      * [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): For running the object detection model.
      * [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): For screen capture and image processing.
      * [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API): For real-time communication with the frontend.

  * **Backend (Data & API):**

      * [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): For serving card data.
      * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): For storing card stats.
      * [Render](https://render.com/)/[Supabase](https://supabase.com/): For hosting the API and database.

## Roadmap: Future Features

This MVP serves as a strong foundation for many powerful features to come:

  * **üîÆ Live Deck Prediction:** Analyze the opponent's first few cards to predict their entire deck archetype based on meta data.
  * **üß† Positive Elixir Trade Suggestions:** Highlight when the user has a significant elixir advantage, signaling an optimal time to attack.
  * **‚ù§Ô∏è Unit Health & Position Tracking:** A more advanced vision model to track unit positions and remaining health for deeper strategic analysis.
  * **üìà Post-Match Analysis:** A summary screen after each match detailing key moments, elixir advantages, and areas for improvement.
  * **‚öôÔ∏è Customization:** Allow users to customize the overlay's position, size, and what information it displays.
